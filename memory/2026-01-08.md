## Lesson Learned: Cron Jobs

**Use `isolated` + `agentTurn` for crons that must execute:**

```json
{
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run: python3 script.py\n\nIf results, notify David. Otherwise stay silent.",
    "deliver": true
  }
}
```

❌ `systemEvent` to `main` session — may be ignored during heartbeat cycles
✅ `agentTurn` to `isolated` session — spawns separate agent that executes

## Day Summary

**Cron fixes:**
- Changed all crons to use `sessionTarget: "isolated"` + `payload.kind: "agentTurn"`
- Added explicit "reply HEARTBEAT_OK" instructions to suppress empty notifications
- Tightened prompts with "No preamble, no confirmation, no extra text"

**MS Teams PR:**
- Merged PR #404 from upstream (4,656 lines by @onutc)
