OpenClaw has two main log surfaces:

- **File logs** (JSON lines) written by the Gateway.
- **Console output** shown in terminals and the Gateway Debug UI.

The Control UI **Logs** tab tails the gateway file log. This page explains where
logs live, how to read them, and how to configure log levels and formats.

## Where logs live

By default, the Gateway writes a rolling log file under:

`/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

The date uses the gateway host's local timezone.

Each file rotates when it reaches `logging.maxFileBytes` (default: 100 MB).
OpenClaw keeps up to five numbered archives beside the active file, such as
`openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.1.log`, and keeps writing to a fresh active log instead of
suppressing diagnostics.

You can override this in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "file": "/path/to/openclaw.log"
  }
}
```

## How to read logs

### CLI: live tail (recommended)

Use the CLI to tail the gateway log file via RPC:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
```

Useful current options:

- `--local-time`: render timestamps in your local timezone
- `--url <url>` / `--token <token>` / `--timeout <ms>`: standard Gateway RPC flags
- `--expect-final`: agent-backed RPC final-response wait flag (accepted here via the shared client layer)

Output modes:

- **TTY sessions**: pretty, colorized, structured log lines.
- **Non-TTY sessions**: plain text.
- `--json`: line-delimited JSON (one log event per line).
- `--plain`: force plain text in TTY sessions.
- `--no-color`: disable ANSI colors.

When you pass an explicit `--url`, the CLI does not auto-apply config or
environment credentials; include `--token` yourself if the target Gateway
requires auth.

In JSON mode, the CLI emits `type`-tagged objects:

- `meta`: stream metadata (file, cursor, size)
- `log`: parsed log entry
- `notice`: truncation / rotation hints
- `raw`: unparsed log line

If the local loopback Gateway asks for pairing, `openclaw logs` falls back to
the configured local log file automatically. Explicit `--url` targets do not
use this fallback.

If the Gateway is unreachable, the CLI prints a short hint to run:

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

### Control UI (web)

The Control UI’s **Logs** tab tails the same file using `logs.tail`.
See [/web/control-ui](/web/control-ui) for how to open it.

### Channel-only logs

To filter channel activity (WhatsApp/Telegram/etc), use:

```bash
openclaw channels logs --channel whatsapp
```

## Log formats

### File logs (JSONL)

Each line in the log file is a JSON object. The CLI and Control UI parse these
entries to render structured output (time, level, subsystem, message).

### Console output

Console logs are **TTY-aware** and formatted for readability:

- Subsystem prefixes (e.g. `gateway/channels/whatsapp`)
- Level coloring (info/warn/error)
- Optional compact or JSON mode

Console formatting is controlled by `logging.consoleStyle`.

### Gateway WebSocket logs

`openclaw gateway` also has WebSocket protocol logging for RPC traffic:

- normal mode: only interesting results (errors, parse errors, slow calls)
- `--verbose`: all request/response traffic
- `--ws-log auto|compact|full`: pick the verbose rendering style
- `--compact`: alias for `--ws-log compact`

Examples:

```bash
openclaw gateway
openclaw gateway --verbose --ws-log compact
openclaw gateway --verbose --ws-log full
```

## Configuring logging

All logging configuration lives under `logging` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "file": "/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log",
    "consoleLevel": "info",
    "consoleStyle": "pretty",
    "redactSensitive": "tools",
    "redactPatterns": ["sk-.*"]
  }
}
```

### Log levels

- `logging.level`: **file logs** (JSONL) level.
- `logging.consoleLevel`: **console** verbosity level.

You can override both via the **`OPENCLAW_LOG_LEVEL`** environment variable (e.g. `OPENCLAW_LOG_LEVEL=debug`). The env var takes precedence over the config file, so you can raise verbosity for a single run without editing `openclaw.json`. You can also pass the global CLI option **`--log-level <level>`** (for example, `openclaw --log-level debug gateway run`), which overrides the environment variable for that command.

`--verbose` only affects console output and WS log verbosity; it does not change
file log levels.

### Console styles

`logging.consoleStyle`:

- `pretty`: human-friendly, colored, with timestamps.
- `compact`: tighter output (best for long sessions).
- `json`: JSON per line (for log processors).

### Redaction

Tool summaries can redact sensitive tokens before they hit the console:

- `logging.redactSensitive`: `off` | `tools` (default: `tools`)
- `logging.redactPatterns`: list of regex strings to override the default set

Redaction applies at the logging sinks for **console output**, **stderr-routed
console diagnostics**, and **file logs**. File logs stay JSONL, but matching
secret values are masked before the line is written to disk.

## Diagnostics and OpenTelemetry

Diagnostics are structured, machine-readable events for model runs and
message-flow telemetry (webhooks, queueing, session state). They do **not**
replace logs — they feed metrics, traces, and exporters. Events are emitted
in-process whether or not you export them.

Two adjacent surfaces:

- **OpenTelemetry export** — send metrics, traces, and logs over OTLP/HTTP to
  any OpenTelemetry-compatible collector or backend (Grafana, Datadog,
  Honeycomb, New Relic, Tempo, etc.). Full configuration, signal catalog,
  metric/span names, env vars, and privacy model live on a dedicated page:
  [OpenTelemetry export](/gateway/opentelemetry).
- **Diagnostics flags** — targeted debug-log flags that route extra logs to
  `logging.file` without raising `logging.level`. Flags are case-insensitive
  and support wildcards (`telegram.*`, `*`). Configure under `diagnostics.flags`
  or via the `OPENCLAW_DIAGNOSTICS=...` env override. Full guide:
  [Diagnostics flags](/diagnostics/flags).

To enable diagnostics events for plugins or custom sinks without OTLP export:

```json5
{
  diagnostics: { enabled: true },
}
```

For OTLP export to a collector, see [OpenTelemetry export](/gateway/opentelemetry).

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Gateway not reachable?** Run `openclaw doctor` first.
- **Logs empty?** Check that the Gateway is running and writing to the file path
  in `logging.file`.
- **Need more detail?** Set `logging.level` to `debug` or `trace` and retry.
