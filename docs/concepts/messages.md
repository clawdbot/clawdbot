# Messages

This page ties together how OpenClaw handles inbound messages, sessions, queueing,
streaming, and reasoning visibility.

## Message flow (high level)

```
Inbound message
  -> routing/bindings -> session key
  -> queue (if a run is active)
  -> agent run (streaming + tools)
  -> outbound replies (channel limits + chunking)
```

Key knobs live in configuration:

- `messages.*` for prefixes, queueing, and group behavior.
- `agents.defaults.*` for block streaming and chunking defaults.
- Channel overrides (`channels.whatsapp.*`, `channels.telegram.*`, etc.) for caps and streaming toggles.

See [Configuration](/gateway/configuration) for full schema.

## Inbound dedupe

Channels can redeliver the same message after reconnects. OpenClaw keeps a
short-lived cache keyed by channel/account/peer/session/message id so duplicate
deliveries do not trigger another agent run.

## Inbound debouncing

Rapid consecutive messages from the **same sender** can be batched into a single
agent turn via `messages.inbound`. Debouncing is scoped per channel + conversation
and uses the most recent message for reply threading/IDs.

Config (global default + per-channel overrides):

```json5
{
  messages: {
    inbound: {
      debounceMs: 2000,
      byChannel: {
        whatsapp: 5000,
        slack: 1500,
        discord: 1500,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Notes:

- Debounce applies to **text-only** messages; media/attachments flush immediately.
- Control commands bypass debouncing so they remain standalone — **except** when a channel explicitly opts in to same-sender DM coalescing (e.g. [BlueBubbles `coalesceSameSenderDms`](/channels/bluebubbles#coalescing-split-send-dms-command--url-in-one-composition)), where DM commands wait inside the debounce window so a split-send payload can join the same agent turn.

## Sessions and devices

Sessions are owned by the gateway, not by clients.

- Direct chats collapse into the agent main session key.
- Groups/channels get their own session keys.
- The session store and transcripts live on the gateway host.

Multiple devices/channels can map to the same session, but history is not fully
synced back to every client. Recommendation: use one primary device for long
conversations to avoid divergent context. The Control UI and TUI always show the
gateway-backed session transcript, so they are the source of truth.

Details: [Session management](/concepts/session).

## Inbound bodies and history context

OpenClaw separates the **prompt body** from the **command body**:

- `Body`: prompt text sent to the agent. This may include channel envelopes and
  optional history wrappers.
- `CommandBody`: raw user text for directive/command parsing.
- `RawBody`: legacy alias for `CommandBody` (kept for compatibility).

When a channel supplies history, it uses a shared wrapper:

- `[Chat messages since your last reply - for context]`
- `[Current message - respond to this]`

For **non-direct chats** (groups/channels/rooms), the **current message body** is prefixed with the
sender label (same style used for history entries). This keeps real-time and queued/history
messages consistent in the agent prompt.

History buffers are **pending-only**: they include group messages that did _not_
trigger a run (for example, mention-gated messages) and **exclude** messages
already in the session transcript.

Directive stripping only applies to the **current message** section so history
remains intact. Channels that wrap history should set `CommandBody` (or
`RawBody`) to the original message text and keep `Body` as the combined prompt.
History buffers are configurable via `messages.groupChat.historyLimit` (global
default) and per-channel overrides like `channels.slack.historyLimit` or
`channels.telegram.accounts.<id>.historyLimit` (set `0` to disable).

## Queueing and followups

If a run is already active, inbound messages can be queued, steered into the
current run, or collected for a followup turn.

- Configure via `messages.queue` (and `messages.queue.byChannel`).
- Modes: `interrupt`, `steer`, `followup`, `collect`, plus backlog variants.

Details: [Queueing](/concepts/queue).

## Streaming, chunking, and batching

Block streaming sends partial replies as the model produces text blocks.
Chunking respects channel text limits and avoids splitting fenced code.

Key settings:

- `agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault` (`on|off`, default off)
- `agents.defaults.blockStreamingBreak` (`text_end|message_end`)
- `agents.defaults.blockStreamingChunk` (`minChars|maxChars|breakPreference`)
- `agents.defaults.blockStreamingCoalesce` (idle-based batching)
- `agents.defaults.humanDelay` (human-like pause between block replies)
- Channel overrides: `*.blockStreaming` and `*.blockStreamingCoalesce` (non-Telegram channels require explicit `*.blockStreaming: true`)

Details: [Streaming + chunking](/concepts/streaming).

## Reasoning visibility and tokens

OpenClaw can expose or hide model reasoning:

- `/reasoning on|off|stream` controls visibility.
- Reasoning content still counts toward token usage when produced by the model.
- Telegram supports reasoning stream into the draft bubble.

Details: [Thinking + reasoning directives](/tools/thinking) and [Token use](/reference/token-use).

## Prefixes, threading, and replies

Outbound message formatting is centralized in `messages`:

- `messages.responsePrefix`, `channels.<channel>.responsePrefix`, and `channels.<channel>.accounts.<id>.responsePrefix` (outbound prefix cascade), plus `channels.whatsapp.messagePrefix` (WhatsApp inbound prefix)
- Reply threading via `replyToMode` and per-channel defaults

Details: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration-reference#messages) and channel docs.

## Silent replies

The exact silent token `NO_REPLY` / `no_reply` means “do not deliver a user-visible reply”.
OpenClaw resolves that behavior by conversation type:

- Direct conversations disallow silence by default and rewrite a bare silent
  reply to a short visible fallback.
- Groups/channels allow silence by default.
- Internal orchestration allows silence by default.

Defaults live under `agents.defaults.silentReply` and
`agents.defaults.silentReplyRewrite`; `surfaces.<id>.silentReply` and
`surfaces.<id>.silentReplyRewrite` can override them per surface.

When the parent session has one or more pending spawned subagent runs, bare
silent replies are dropped on all surfaces instead of being rewritten, so the
parent stays quiet until the child completion event delivers the real reply.
